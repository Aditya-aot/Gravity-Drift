ðŸŽ® Excited to share my latest game project: Digmoid Drift! ðŸš€

I've created a physics-based puzzle game where players navigate through space using the gravitational forces of planets. Place different sized planets strategically to guide your character to the goal while avoiding obstacles!

Key features:
- Real-time gravity physics simulation
- 7 increasingly challenging levels
- Multiple planet types with different gravitational strengths
- Obstacles like spikes and walls that require careful navigation

Built using C++ with the Raylib framework, this project challenged me to implement realistic physics interactions while creating engaging puzzle gameplay.
